      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>VDTC is a collective of like-minded Tigrayans in the diaspora advocating for justice, peace, and the restoration of the constitutional rights of the Tigrayan people. Our mission is grounded in an unwavering commitment to truth, democracy, human dignity, and territorial integrity. We are not affiliated with any political party, organization, or government—our commitment is solely to the people of Tigray and their future. VDTC actively engages in diplomatic outreach to support the people of Tigray and serves as a bridge between the diaspora and those on the ground. Through letters, public statements, and direct dialogue with local leaders, we ensure that our efforts reflect the real needs and priorities of Tigrayans. Our focus is change, stability, peace, and justice.</p>
