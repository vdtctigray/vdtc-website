    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>Voices of Diaspora Tigray for Change (VDTC) is a collective of Tigrayan professionals, students, and advocates living across the global diaspora. We are united by a shared commitment to justice, truth, and the protection of Tigray’s people, identity, and rights.</p>
    <p>We are a grassroots, volunteer-based initiative. We are not affiliated with any political party or government. Our focus is people-centered — we speak for civilians, victims, and displaced communities whose voices have been silenced or ignored.</p>
