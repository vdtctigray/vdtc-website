        <h2>About VDTC</h2>
        <p>Voices of Diaspora Tigray for Change (VDTC) was formed by Tigrayan professionals, students, and advocates living in the global diaspora. United by a shared sense of responsibility, we aim to amplify the voices of those silenced by war, displacement, and injustice.</p>
        <p>Our work focuses on advocacy, public awareness, and truth-based documentation of the Tigray genocide and its long-term effects on civilians. We are not affiliated with any political entity — our cause is people-centered and rooted in the values of democracy and justice.</p>
