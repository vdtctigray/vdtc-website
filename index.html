      <h2>About VDTC</h2>
      <p>Voices of Diaspora Tigray for Change (VDTC) was formed by Tigrayan professionals, students, and advocates living in the global diaspora. United by a shared sense of responsibility, we aim to amplify the voices of those silenced by war, displacement, and injustice.</p>
